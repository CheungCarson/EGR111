| **Office Space Calc**        |     |       |  |
| - Refactored based on review | 3   |  2   | Runs but errors. No semicolon in #define preprocessor. Consistent indents.  |
| **Solar Panel Calc**         |     |       |  |
| - Refactored based on review | 3   |  1    | Error in calcs. See reference for typical load. Your result is not in line with expected value. LIne 31 changes meaning of variable. Unit was ft. Use another variable like roof_length. Cast both length and width. Not the product. Do you see the error with your approach? Load is lbs/sqft.|
| **RGB Converter**            |     |       | This is good work! Yes, structure can be improved but you solved! |
